# Create Design Document Command

Generate comprehensive technical design documents for features and systems.

## Instructions

Create a detailed design document that covers all aspects of the proposed feature or system. Structure the document to
facilitate thorough review and implementation planning.

### Document Structure

#### 1. Overview

- **Problem Statement**: Clearly define the problem being solved
- **Solution Summary**: High-level description of the proposed approach
- **Success Metrics**: How success will be measured
- **Timeline**: Estimated development and rollout schedule

#### 2. Requirements

- **Functional Requirements**: What the system must do
- **Non-functional Requirements**: Performance, scalability, security constraints
- **User Stories**: Key user interactions and workflows
- **Constraints**: Technical, business, or regulatory limitations

#### 3. Technical Design

- **System Architecture**: High-level system components and interactions
- **API Design**: Endpoint specifications, request/response formats
- **Data Model**: Database schema, data flow, and storage considerations
- **Technology Stack**: Languages, frameworks, and tools to be used

#### 4. Implementation Plan

- **Development Phases**: Break down work into manageable phases
- **Dependencies**: Internal and external dependencies
- **Risk Assessment**: Potential risks and mitigation strategies
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing approaches

#### 5. Operations & Deployment

- **Deployment Strategy**: How the system will be deployed
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Key metrics and alert conditions
- **Rollback Plan**: How to revert if issues arise
- **Maintenance**: Ongoing operational considerations

### Writing Guidelines

- **Clear and concise**: Use simple language and avoid unnecessary jargon
- **Visual aids**: Include diagrams, flowcharts, and mockups where helpful
- **Reviewable**: Structure content to facilitate feedback and discussion
- **Actionable**: Provide enough detail for implementation teams
- **Version controlled**: Design for iterative updates and refinement
